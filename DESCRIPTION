Description: Creates customizable CONSORT-style flowcharts for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using DiagrammeR. 
These flowcharts are found in the beginning of RCT research papers, summarizing the study's design and analysis. 
This package takes a dataset and a column of values indicating the group names- typically, there is one control and one treatment group. 
This package is made for RCTs that follow exactly two groups. Features like color, font, and text are customizable as they will not affect
the flowchart structure.
